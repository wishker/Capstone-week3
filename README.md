**Capstone Project - The Falafel Battle of Neighborhoods**

**Introduction**

New York City (NYC), often called The City or simply New York (NY), is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2019 population of 8,336,817 distributed over 784 km2. New York is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. It is located at the southern tip of the U.S. state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, the largest metropolitan area in the world by urban landmass.

New York City&#39;s food culture includes many international cuisines influenced by the city&#39;s immigrant history. Central and Eastern European immigrants, especially Jewish immigrants from those regions, brought bagels, cheesecake, hot dogs and knishes while Italian immigrants brought New York-style pizza and Italian cuisine into the city. Chinese and other Asian restaurants, sandwich joints, trattorias, diners, and coffeehouses can be found tthroughout the city. Some 4,000 mobile food vendors licensed by the city, many immigrant-owned, have made Middle Eastern foods such as falafel and kebabs.

Falafel is a deep-fried ball shaped patty, made mainly from ground chickpeas some herbs, spices, and onion relatives. It is a well-known Middle Eastern dish that most likely originated in Egypt.

In this project, we will list and map all major parts of New York City that has Falafel restaurants.
